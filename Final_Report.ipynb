    "#### The goal of this project is to build a classification model to know if a waterpump is in need of repair. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The problem this project is addressing is access to water by way of community waterpoints. Access to water is an important issue that has reverberations in the social and economic aspects of a society. The [World Health Organization writes](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water#:~:text=Safe%20and%20readily%20available%20water,contribute%20greatly%20to%20poverty%20reduction.), “Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes. Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction.” \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The water pumps we are looking at in our modeling are meant to provide potable water. If these water pumps fail, that community’s availability of drinking water is impacted. Reduced availability of working water pumps means an increased use of the functional ones, which could mean a reduction in that water pumps lifespan before it needs repairs. Being able to know which waterpoints need maintenance can help that community have a minimal interruption of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This model will be used by the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to assess which water pumps need to be repaired. This model helps the goals of the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to provide access to water to its citizens. By knowing which water pumps need repairs, the Ministry of Water can implement better maintenance strategies. Moreover, this model and implementation of outcomes can help towards [The Tanzanian Development Vision 2025](https://mof.go.tz/mofdocs/overarch/vision2025.htm) to have universal access to safe water by the year 2025."
